  of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world,
  connecting every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and
  event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what's happening
  around the world, what its context is and who's involved, and how the world is
  feeling about it, every single day."
